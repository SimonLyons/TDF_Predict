Analysis Plan



I want the ability to predict the final GC result for riders in the Tour De France. I intend to do this by identifying a relationship between this result and range of related variables. 

These variables could include (but not be limited to):

a. Previous TDF GC finishing position
b. Average previous GC finishing of current team
c. Finishing position of key races (Dauphine, etc)
d. Total race miles that year
