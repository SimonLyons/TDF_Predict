# MySQL QUERIES
# 
# I'm going to build a query pulling rider details from the rider table
# in the ProCycling database.
# 
#          ### WHERE filter based on rider###
# Build a WHERE criteria list of all the riders who completed the 2016 TdF
WHERE_rider <- paste0("rider_name = '", results_df$Rider[1], "'")
for (r in 2:length(results_df$Rider)){

}

# Paste together the criteria for the MySQL query
criteria <- paste0("SELECT * FROM rider_list_master WHERE ", WHERE_rider, ";")

# Perform the MySQL query, 
rider_table <- dbGetQuery(conn_local, criteria)
View(rider_table)

# Okay - so this is the first time I've gone looking for rider names as a query from
# the ProCycling database and immediately it's obvious I've not retrieved all of the
# riders in my list. 

# The other signficant observation is the dob values have incorrect years listed. The 
# date and month seem to be correct, but the year is 2019 for all the riders I've seen.

# Convert DOB column to 'Date' class
rider_table$dob <- as.Date(rider_table$dob)
glimpse(rider_table)

# The good news (regarding dob) is I can obtain the correct DOB for each rider from
# their UCI number. I've inserted this corrected dob in my table under the field 'dob_c' 
rider_table$dob_c <- ymd(substr(rider_table$uci_id , 4, 11))

# Once the results table and rider table are merged the missing riders are obvious.

# Alejandro Valverde is the first big name I can see is missing. Looking at his 
# Cycling News profile which has his name as Alejandro Valverde Belmonte:
# http://www.cyclingnews.com/riders/alejandro-valverde-belmonte/
# So I'll do a query on the database for this name to check

rider_avb <- dbGetQuery(conn_local, "SELECT * FROM rider_list_master 
                        WHERE rider_name = 'Alejandro Valverde Belmonte';")

# The above returns data for Alejandro appropriately confirming the name issue

# I'll now use the SOUNDEX function to see if it can be used to obtain better results
# Firstly - testing with just Alejandro Valverde

rider_avb_SOUNDEX <- dbGetQuery(conn_local, "SELECT * FROM rider_list_master

# The above does not return anything for a string less than 'Alejandro Valverde Belmont'
# So I'm looking for other fuzzy string matching techniques for MySQL. There MUST be some!




# So in order to use the MATCH / AGAINST query functions it appears I need to have
# the column I'm searching indexed as a FULLTEXT column. Here I modify rider_name:
dbSendQuery(conn_local, "ALTER TABLE rider_list_master ADD FULLTEXT(rider_name);")

# I can now use the FULLTEXT search command which works successfully.
rider_avb_MATCH <- dbGetQuery(conn_local, "SELECT * FROM rider_list_master 
                        WHERE MATCH(rider_name) AGAINST ('Ben King');")

########## Narrow MySQL FULLTEXT search results
# I'm getting far more results (+500) than just the list of riders I'm submitting to
# the database query using the 2016 TdF rider list. I need to look at how my search
# results can be limited to the best result for each rider.

# Paste together the criteria for the MySQL query
